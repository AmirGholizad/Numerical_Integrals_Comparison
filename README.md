# Numerical_Integrals_Comparison
In this project we're comparing the results of these 3 numerical integrating methods:
- MonteCarlo Method
- Trapezoidal Method
- Simpson Method 

The Results show that:
- The MonteCarlo method is the fastest, but least accurate method.
- The Simpson method is slightly faster than Trapezoidal method but with same degree of accuracy.
